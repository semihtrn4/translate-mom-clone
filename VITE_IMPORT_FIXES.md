# Vite Import Resolution Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Import Path Resolution
- Fixed import paths in `src/services/ffmpegService.ts`:
  - Changed relative paths back to alias paths (`@/`) to resolve Vite import issues
  - Using `@/integrations/supabase/client` instead of `../../integrations/supabase/client.ts`

### 2. TypeScript Configuration
- Ensured `tsconfig.app.json` has correct path mappings:
  - `"@/*": ["./src/*"]` in the paths configuration
- Verified `tsconfig.json` also has the correct path mappings

### 3. Deno Configuration
- Updated `deno.json` to include "dom" in the lib array:
  - This is required for proper console and FormData support
  - Following the memory requirements for Deno project configuration

### 4. Environment Variables Documentation
- Created `.env.local.example` in the `supabase/functions` directory:
  - Documents required environment variables for local development
  - Includes Supabase configuration and Python backend service URL

## Files Modified

1. `src/services/ffmpegService.ts` - Fixed import paths to use alias paths
2. `tsconfig.app.json` - Verified correct path mappings
3. `tsconfig.json` - Verified correct path mappings
4. `deno.json` - Added "dom" to lib array
5. `supabase/functions/.env.local.example` - Created environment variables documentation

## Verification

After these changes:
- Vite should be able to resolve imports correctly
- TypeScript should properly type-check the code
- Deno should have proper support for console and FormData
- Environment variables are documented for local development

## Next Steps

1. Restart the Vite development server
2. Verify that the import errors are resolved
3. Test the video processing functionality
4. Ensure the Edge Function properly calls the Python backend service
